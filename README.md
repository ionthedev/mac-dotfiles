Put the following in ~/.config 
- borders
- karabiner
- nvim
- skhd
- yabai

I put .tmux.conf and .wezterm.lua in my Users directory but you can put that where ever you want, 
just make sure to properly link the terminal and tmux config to the applications.

Wallpapers contain the custom wallpapers I did from unsplash images, the file names contain the credits.

Everything is riced to the Kanagawa color palette
